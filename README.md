i think ure a really chaotic person

i was on linkedin and i dont use it, i dont care for it, ive gotten hired many places without linkedin, but i remembered that i had u blocked on there for YEARS, and i unblocked u to see what u were doing, and then it wouldnt let me block u again for another 2 fking days, so finally, i blocked u and i swear i was like, what a relief, like what a chaotic fking person

thats ur thing now, that's the "energy" ure giving off, like pure chaos

oh wait there was a plan, "the plan" was, u end up with someone else, i end up with someone else, and after a specific number of yrs which u always knew of, what, 8? 9? 10? yrs, we meet again. obv im not wasting my life with just anyone my standards are pretty fking high but im not ending up with the kind of person u ended up with, but that's a loser plan, but thats been ur plan, the "ure my second choice plan." u could have left and we would have been alright. u got caught up in this game.

i would literally laugh out loud, literally, i would, if its verified one day, probably through you, that the way u met the person u're with, was on the internet. that would be so fking funny to me.
